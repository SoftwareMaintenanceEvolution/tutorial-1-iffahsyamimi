Hi there!
### ![Panda](./panda-sme.jpg)
I'm a final year software engineering student and I'm taking Software Maintenance and Evolution for this semester.
#### 🔍 My expectation on this course:
I expect to gain a deep understanding of how to effectively manage and improve the existing software systems where I expect to learn on the maintenance strategies, code refactoring, version control and software evolution, legacy systems, bug fixing and debugging and lastly learn on the documentation and testing where I believed that it play a big role in maintaining the systems.
#### 🤝 I am currently working on:
##### Wellness Wise (Daily mental health web application)
##### Southeast Asia Association for Dental Education (SEAADE) websites
